How to compile: Type "make"

How to run: Type either "./project1" or "./project1 text.txt"

Note: If things are not visible when program is ran, try 
running again in full-screen.

Note: The 'save' feature on the menu only works if the original file 
	you are working in is called "text.txt" The 'save as'
	feature should work perfectly fine.

DISCLAIMER: Some of the ncurses code has been derived from 
	the ncurses tutorials online.
